----------

In no particular order of importance, size, complexity or urgency.

1. Debug
--------

Some things have been debugged.

1.a general ref counting
------------------------

Overall not enough care has been spent putting the get/put and
create/delete parings to make sure release works throughout the driver
on all levels.

1.b Start_event
---------------

New code needs debugging.

1.c DMA Overall State Machine
-----------------------------

start event prodding the DMA engine to start transfers of binds, completeion from
DMA generating events back to let the next start event begin.

1.d Delete and tear down code
-----------------------------

We've focussed on creating everything and now getting it to actually DMA. Then we
need to get the delete tear down functions to work.

2. Unfinished
-------------

I think only the network emulation of DMA is missing... rddma_dma_net.[ch]?

The delete code for 1.d may be incomplete place holders in many cases...

3. Enhancements
---------------

Once the above framework is complete and debugged and working we can
start adding a whole boat load of enhancements.

3.1 Access Permissions
----------------------
Giving SMBs ugo permissions carrying same in transactions enforcing.
Capability checking.
etc

3.2 Scope
---------

This is basically in there with local based base location vs fabric
based base location giving local private domains between processes on
a node versus processes between nodes. Providing multiple node domains
is also probably in by just creating more fabric based base locations.

3.3 QoS
-------

We need to start thinking about how to prioritize and schedule the
various DMA transfers according to QoS policies instead of just fifo
lists. 

3.4 ????
--------

Feel free to add.
