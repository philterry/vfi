In your kernel source tree create a sysmlink drivers/vfi to this
source tree (the parent of the directory containing this README).

In your kernel source tree create a symlink Documentation/DocBook/vfi.tmpl 
to the vfi.tmpl file in this directory.

Edit the Makefile in Documentation/DocBook to add vfi.xml to DOCBOOKS or
make vfi.xml the only documentation to be produced, your choice.

Now where ever you build your *kernel* you can issue make with the normal
documentation targets to build the documentation of your choice.

make help will show you the targets

	make mandocs
	make htmldocs
	make pdfdocs

etc, etc.
